# Efficient-Diagnosis-of-diseases-in-rice-crop-using-machine-learning
Rice is a key staple crop, and productivity is highly impacted by numerous diseases. Conventional disease diagnosis approaches are based on manual examination, which is cumbersome and subject to errors. The present work puts forward a framework for rice disease diagnosis using a machine learning technique based on convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model was trained on a database of images of diseased and healthy rice leaves and reached 84.8% classification accuracy. The system is developed to deployed as a web application to aid farmers in the early detection of disease and prescriptive treatment, hence enhancing crop yield. The use of cutting-edge technologies like machine learning(ml) and deep learning (dl) is capable of addressing these challenges through the early detection of plant diseases. 
Due to a variety of diseases in Rice crop, it is not easy to diagnose the type of it based on the impact it causes on the crop i.e., colour of the leaf and stem. In this report, we designed an efficient CNN model for disease detection using Machine learning.
